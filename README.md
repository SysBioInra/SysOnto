The BIPON directory contains the ontologies BIPON, toyBiPON, and bioBIPON of the paper: 
Henry, Vincent J., et al. "The bacterial interlocked process ONtology (BiPON): a systemic multi-scale unified representation of biological processes in prokaryotes." Journal of biomedical semantics 8.1 (2017): 53.

The BIPOm directory contains the ontologies BIPOm-core, and the instantiated and inferred ontologies for two uses cases: 
- the reductive pentose-phosphate cycle (RPPC) of Arabidopsis thaliana
- the cytosolic metabolic network of Escherichia coli
